### What is it?
We're no strangers to this familiar scene.

We're in a group trying to figure out what we should eat, and some smart guy decides it'd be a good idea to ask yelp. Immediately, we're confronted with 934780832 different food options and we're faced with the burden of choice.

Enter eateasy. The easiest and cleanest way to find great food for a group gathering, leveraging insights from Yelp and IBM Watson.

Eateasy aims to make your discovery process as easy and seamless as possible. You tell it what you cannot eat, what you cannot afford to eat, and it gives you the top restaurant in your immediate vicinity.

### Much features very wow
This was already an awesome product that we could see ourselves using on a daily basis, but why stop there? We added cool features to make your food discovery process **_even easier_**.
- Shows you the restaurant location and provides directions
- Generates a happiness score for the restaurant based on the sentiment of their tweets
